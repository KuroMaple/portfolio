        Back in 2015, during a particularly late night I messed around with Roblox Studio to try and make a game. 
        I was mesmerized by the notion of bringing my wildest, most intrusive ideas to life.

        At some point during my confused blundering of the complex Game-dev tool, I realized that I was more interested in the code than the game itself.
        I found true joy in the intersection of video game aesthetics and the accessibility of the web.
        Fast-forward to today, and I've built software for a GIS company, my local badminton club, and for all my fellow Pokemon fans.

        I still play video games, and am currently working on a game of my own. Otherwise you can find me straining in the gym, 
        playing badminton, bouldering, or goofing off with my friends and family.
