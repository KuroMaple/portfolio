        Back in 2015, I discovered&nbsp;
        <a href='https://create.roblox.com' className='welcome__text-links' id='welcome-roblox' target='_blank'>
          Roblox Studio
        </a>
        &nbsp;and set out to create a game that would make me "Robux Rich." 
        While initially driven by  greed, I quickly became captivated by the process of coding and the ability to bring my most creative and unconventional ideas to life.

        This early exploration sparked my passion for software development, especially at the intersection of engaging design and accessible web technologies.
        Since then, I've had the privilege of building web software for a&nbsp;
        <a href='https://www.janacorporation.com' className='welcome__text-links' target='_blank'>GIS company</a>,&nbsp;
        my university's&nbsp;
        <a href='https://uwbc-web-demo.netlify.app' className='welcome__text-links' target='_blank' >badminton</a> 
        &nbsp;club, and a project dedicated to&nbsp;
        <a href='https://poke-view.netlify.app' className='welcome__text-links' target='_blank' >Pok√©mon</a> 
        &nbsp;fans.

      Today, I'm passionate about developing interactive 
      and user-friendly applications, whether that's through 
      front-end development, full-stack solutions, or even game design. 
      When I'm not coding, you'll find me pushing my limits at the gym, 
      competing on the badminton court, bouldering, or spending quality time with friends and family.
