        Back in 2015, I messed around with Roblox Studio to try and make a game to make me Robux Rich. 
        Beyond greed, I was motivated by the notion of bringing my wildest, most intrusive ideas to life.

        At some point during my confused blundering, I realized that I was more interested in the code than the game itself.
        I found true joy in the intersection of video game aesthetics and the accessibility of the web.
        Fast-forward to today, and I've built web software for a GIS company, my local badminton club, and for all my fellow Pok√©mon fans.

      <p>
        To this day I still play video games, and I hope to one day release my own games. Otherwise you can find me straining in the gym, 
        playing badminton, bouldering, or goofing off with my friends and family.
